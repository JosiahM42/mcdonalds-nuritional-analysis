# mcdonalds-nuritional-analysis
An exploratory analysis of a Kaggle dataset by McDonald's on menu nutrition. With a focus on what you should eat if you are on a specific diet.
- This was programmed using python and uses the following frameworks:
  - numpy

  - seaborn
## What was discovered
From this exploratory analysis, I discovered that for certain diets such as 
  - Low Carbohydrate Diet
  - Low Fat Diet

McDonald's can be consumed, however only if you eat certain products.
