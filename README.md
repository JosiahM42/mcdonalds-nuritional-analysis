# mcdonalds-nuritional-analysis
An exploratory analysis of a Kaggle dataset by McDonald's on menu nutrition. With a focus on what you should eat if you are on a specific diet.
- This was programmed using python and uses the following frameworks:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
## What was discovered
From this exploratory analysis, I discovered that for certain diets such as 
  - Low Carbohydrate Diet
  - Low Fat Diet
  - High Protein Diets
  
McDonald's can be consumed, however only if you eat certain products.

### Low carb diet
If someone was on a low carb diet, at McDonalds they could eat:

| Breakfast | Salads | Sides | Beverages |
